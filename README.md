# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
Challenge 7

## Overview of the analysis:
In this analysis, we will be trying to determine the number of employees that would be retiring by title and also, to identify which employees are eligible to participate in the "mentorship program" that the company is developing. 

We will consider as retiring employees all employees born between January, 1 1952 and December, 31 1955.


### Results:

* One of the main takeaways from the analysis is that 72,458 employees will be retiring soon. 

* Most of the employees that are about to be retiring are at senior level positions. This is why management has to put extra effort on making a smooth transition.

* Another point to consider is that employees don't always stay in the same position for the duration of their careers. This could be a helpful insight to consider internal promotions and cross-trining to cover some of the management positions with lower-level current employees internally, instead of outsourcing all new hires.

* Finally, management should be focusing in the areas where the majority of retirees are (Engineer or Staff position) when implementing their new hiring strategies.


### Summary: 

Management will have to face a "silver tsunamy" of 72,458 roles total. But only 1,549 of them are elegible to be mentors in the program they are putting in place.

This means that there won't be enough mentors to coach the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees.

An additional query that would be helpful to better understand management's situation is one in which shows a breakdown of titles for the employees that are eligible for the mentorship program.
